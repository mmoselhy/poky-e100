2011-11-02:
	* (seebs) Call this 1.2 because the UNLOAD change is moderately
	  significant, and so's the clone change.

2011-11-01:
	* (mhatle) Stop valgrind from reporting use of uninitialized
	  memory from pseudo_client:client_ping()

	* (mhatle) change from internal PSEUDO_RELOADED to external
	  PSEUDO_UNLOAD environment variable.  Enable external programs
	  to have a safe and reliable way to unload pseudo on the next
	  exec*.  PSEUDO_UNLOAD also will disable pseudo if we're in a
	  fork/clone situation in the same way PSEUDO_DISABLED=1 would.

	* (seebs) initialize a variable in that "realpath" code.

2011-06-08:

2011-06-06:
	* (seebs) revise system() handler substantially.  It now

	  can have an official branch and not need to use git.
	* (seebs) add "tarball" make target.

2011-06-02:
	* (seebs) intercept system() so the pseudo environment is
	  properly set for it.
	* (seebs) call this "1.1" since the cumulative result of all
	  of these changes is pretty big.

2011-05-31:
	* (seebs) Don't mask in 0100 to filesystem modes for things which
	  are not actually directories, because this breaks the special
	  logic in euidaccess for X_OK.

2011-05-25:
	* (seebs) fix for ulckpwdf()

2011-04-21:
	* (seebs) don't use strerror in wrappers, because it can
	  lead to malloc deadlocks if part of setting up a malloc
	  operation falls into strerror which uses locale... Curse
	  you, Fedora 13.  You and your perfectly reasonable and
	  standards-conforming behavior which happened to inconvenience
	  me.

2011-04-16:
	* (seebs) remove duplicate definition of real_clone() from
	  the oldclone port.

	  pseudo binary is invoked directly by a user before being spawned
	  by the client.

2011-02-09:
	* (seebs) the long-awaited cleanup of the database initialization
