pseudolog
	Displays or creates log entries.  This offers a quick first
	approximation of the sorts of queries one is likely to need to
	run.

pseudo
	The pseudo server.  Run on the command line, the default behavior
	is to set up a pseudo environment (LD_PRELOAD, etc) then run either
	the specified command or a shell by default.  The -d option specifies
	a background daemon, and -f specifies a foreground daemon (which
	may display output directly).  The launcher function isn't really
	32-bit/64-bit aware, but if you have both types of libraries in
	suitably-named directories, it'll do the right thing anyway.

	Path may be in environment as PSEUDO_PREFIX, specified on command
	line with -P path, or inferred from the path to $0.  (The last
	generates a diagnostic.)

	To stop the pseudo server, either wait a while (the default timeout
	is 30 seconds, or whatever you specified with "-t" or PSEUDO_OPTS
	when starting it) or run "pseudo -S".  The server will not exit
	while clients are active, but requesting a shutdown sets the timeout
	to one second, so it will exit quickly after the last client
	disconnects.

libpseudo.so
	The library providing the wrapper functionality, which spawns
	the pseudo server automatically if needed.  If the environment
	variable PSEUDO_ENOSYS_ABORT is set, attempts to call missing
	system calls will abort() rather than merely emitting a diagnostic.

pseudodb
	allows browsing and modification of db (not implemented)
