There's a new "perftest" program. I recommend you run it with a ramdisk. So,
if you've mounted a ramdisk on /tmp/ram:
	./perftest /tmp/ram

This is a pretty unscientific test, but is designed to exercise some
reasonably common use cases and give ballpark figures as to the effect
of changes to the database indexes, etc.
