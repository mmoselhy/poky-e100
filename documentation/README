documentation
=============

This is the location for the Yocto Project documentation.  Documentation 
consists of six manuals (see below).

Manual Organization
===================

Folders exist for individual manuals as follows:

* adt-manual       - The Yocto Project Application Development Toolkit (ADT)
                     User's Guide.
* bsp-guide        - The Yocto Project Board Support (BSP) Developer's Guide
* dev-manual       - The Yocto Project Development Manual
* kernel-manual    - The Yocto Project Kernel Architecture and Use Manual
* poky-ref-manual  - The Yocto Project Reference Manual
* yocto-project-qs - The Yocto Project Quick Start

Each folder is self-contained regarding content and figures. 

Makefile
========

The Makefile processes manual directories to create HTML, PDF,
tarballs, etc.  Details on how the Makefile work are documented
inside the Makefile.  See that file for more information.

To build a manual, you run the make command and pass it the name
of the folder containing the manual's contents. 
For example, the following command run from the documentation directory 
creates an HTML and a PDF version of the ADT manual.
The DOC variable specifies the manual you are making:

     $ make DOC=adt-manual

poky.ent
========

This file defines variables used for documentation production.  The variables
are used to define release pathnames, URLs for the published manuals, etc.

template
========
Contains various templates, fonts, and some old PNG files.

tools
=====
Contains a tool to convert the DocBook files to PDF format.
